To create a new unit test suite and integrate it into the build, do the
following.

First, copy the check_TMPL.cpp file to a new filename. "check_l33th4x0r.cpp"
might be chosen for testing the "l33th4x0r" module. Edit the file and change
the name of the test module and any other constants.

Second, add the name of your check (i.e. check_l33th4x0r) to the
CMakeLists.txt.
